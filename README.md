Project Overview:

  DriverPass was a system analysis and design project focused on creating a web-based system for a driving instruction company. 
  The client wanted a platform that would allow students to create accounts, schedule driving lessons, access online practice materials, and manage payments.
  The goal was to design a system that improved scheduling effciency, customer communication, and overall user experience.

  What I Did Well:
    One area I performed well in was translating business requirments into clear system documentation. I created structured UML diagrams and organized requirements in a way that connected user needs to system functionality.
    I created structured UML diagrams and organized requirments in a way that connected user needs to system functionality. 
    My actvity diagram and system design documentation clearly demonstrated how users interact with the system and how backend processes support those interactions.

  What I Would Improve:
    To design the system, I carefully reviewed the client's goals and identified key user roles such as students, instructors, administrators.
    I focused on ensuring that scheduling, account management, and communication workflows were simple and logical.
    Considering user needs is essential because a technically correct system can still fail if it is not intuitive or aligned with howm users actually interact with it.

  My Approach to Designing Software:
    When designing software, I begin by identifying stakeholders and gathering clear requirments. I break the system into components, model workflows using UML diagrams, and ensure functional and nonfunctional requirements are addressed. 
    In the future, I plan to continue using structured modeling techniques, iterative feedback, and user centered design principles to create systems that are both techically sound and practical for real world use.
